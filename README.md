# TI-Common
Some common code arranged into libraries to help reduce development overheads in TotallyInformation's repositories

Please feel free to use this code as you choose. However, it is without any warrantee and may change at any time.

These libraries are primarily to support my Node-RED Nodes such as [node-red-contrib-uibuilder](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/node-red-contrib-uibuilder), [node-red-contrib-moment](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/node-red-contrib-moment) and [node-red-contrib-fs](https://github.com/TotallyInformation/node-red-contrib-fs).
